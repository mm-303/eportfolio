  <h1>Security and Risk Management</h1>
  <p>In the <strong>Security and Risk Management</strong> module, I delved into the intertwined nature of security and risk within modern enterprises. As businesses transition from traditional siloed operations to integrated, enterprise-wide solutions, understanding how security and risk management overlap becomes crucial. This module provided comprehensive insights into various areas where security and risk interact, including methods of risk assessment, threat modeling, and the implementation of security standards. I explored both qualitative and quantitative risk assessment techniques, traditional and hybrid risk models like STRIDE, DREAD, and Attack Trees, and common security standards such as PCI-DSS. Additionally, the module covered business continuity and disaster recovery (DR) solutions, and highlighted key research topics driving advancements in security and risk management.</p>

  <p>By the end of this module I was able to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Describe when to use qualitative and quantitative risk assessments.</li>
    <li>Create threat models for various scenarios.</li>
    <li>Create quantitative risk models.</li>
    <li>Design and explain DR strategies and solutions.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1><a href="assets/PDFs/Development Team Project Final.pdf"> Development Team Project: Risk Identification Report </a></h1>
  
  <p>In <strong>Assignment Part 1: A Report by a Security and Risk Management Team</strong>, our team was tasked with conducting a comprehensive risk assessment for Pampered Pets, a bricks-and-mortar business based in Hashington-on-the-Water. The objective was to evaluate the risks associated with both the current operational state and the proposed digitalisation process, ultimately recommending whether the business should proceed with digital transformation.</p>
  
  <h2>Current Risk Assessment</h2>
  <p>We carried out a risk assessment of Pampered Pets as it stood currently, which included the following tasks:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Selection of Risk Assessment Methodology:</strong> We selected a combination of ISO 31000 and Qualitative Risk Assessment (Hybrid Framework Approach), providing justifications for our choice based on the business's specific needs and operational context.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Risk and Threat Modelling:</strong> We conducted a thorough risk and threat modelling exercise to enumerate and evaluate the existing threats and risks facing the business. This included identifying operational risks, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and financial risks related to digital transaction records using the OCTAVE Framework.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Identification of Mitigation Strategies:</strong> We compiled a comprehensive list of potential mitigations to address the identified risks and threats. These mitigations aimed to enhance cybersecurity measures, upgrade the warehouse management system, and ensure accurate financial auditing.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Digitalisation Risk Assessment</h2>
  <p>We also performed a risk assessment focused on the potential digitalisation process for Pampered Pets, which involved the following:</p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Selection of Risk Assessment Methodology:</strong> We chose the OCTAVE framework as risk assessment methodology for evaluating the digitalisation process, justifying our selection based on its effectiveness in assessing technological transformations.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Listing of Proposed Changes:</strong> We outlined the proposed changes that would form the basis of the digitalisation process, including the implementation of an e-commerce portal, adoption of an ERP system, expansion of online marketing efforts, and the introduction of blogs.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Risk and Threat Modelling Exercise:</strong> We executed a risk and threat modelling exercise to identify and assess the potential threats and risks associated with the proposed digitalisation changes. This included evaluating increased cyber threats, operational disruptions during the transition, and customer retention risks.</li>
    
    <li><strong>Identification of Mitigation Strategies:</strong> We developed a list of potential mitigations to counteract the identified risks and threats related to digitalisation. </li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Conclusions</h2>
  <p>Pampered Pets faces a variety of risks, both from its IT infrastructure and its reliance on local suppliers. The OCTAVE framework has helped identify critical assets, potential threats, and vulnerabilities, leading to specific mitigation strategies. By implementing the recommended actions, Pampered Pets can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of risks, safeguarding its business operations, customer data, and financial integrity. </p>

  <h2>Unit 12: The Great Debate: What will be the most influential trend in SRM in the next 5 years?</h2>
  <p>In <strong>Unit 12: The Great Debate: What will be the most influential trend in SRM in the next 5 years?</strong>, the final unit of the module, I participated in a collaborative debate to determine which of four global trends—AI, Automation, Web 3.0, or Security—will have the most significant impact on SRM over the next five years. The unit involved discussions, presentations, and voting to decide the most influential trend.</p>

  <p>By the end of this unit, I was able to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Describe the main emerging trends in the field.</li>
    <li>Argue for which trend I believe to be the most influential.</li>
    
  </ul>
