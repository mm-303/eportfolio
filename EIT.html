  <h2>Unit 1: An Introduction to EIT</h2>
  <p>In <strong>Unit 1: An Introduction to EIT</strong>, I explored the foundational concepts of Enterprise IT (EIT) and how it differs from other trends like Business Information Systems and Industry 4.0/5.0. The focus was on understanding what EIT is, its historical evolution (EIT Eras), and key frameworks like the EIT knowledge tree. We discussed the importance of standards such as TOGAF and ITIL, along with bodies of knowledge (BoKs) like PMBOK and SEBOK, which help define the field.</p>

  <p>By the end of this unit, I gained a clear understanding of what EIT is and its relevance in modern business. I learned how to explain EIT, identify key BoKs for EIT practitioners, and describe a transformative EIT component that has impacted business.</p>

  <p>The lecturecast covered EIT definitions, technology eras, enterprise architecture, and the differences between traditional IT and EIT devices. We also touched on Industry 4.0 and 5.0, emphasizing automation and its role in business.</p>

  <p>For further insight, the reading focused on an introduction to EIT, along with relevant standards and bodies, particularly the SFIA list of bodies of knowledge, providing a deeper dive into the standards governing this field.</p>

  <h2>Unit 2: EIT vs. Shadow IT</h2>
  <p>In <strong>Unit 2: EIT vs. Shadow IT</strong>, I explored the differences between formally sanctioned Enterprise IT (EIT) and the more informal, unsanctioned Shadow IT (also known as Stealth or Hobbyist IT). EIT typically follows formal processes like the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), while Shadow IT is more ad hoc, often seen as more responsive and creative. However, Shadow IT can expose businesses to additional risks, such as cybersecurity threats.</p>

  <p>This unit focused on understanding why some companies or departments adopt Shadow IT despite the risks and how businesses can evaluate its effectiveness. We discussed the balance between innovation and risk, as well as the potential benefits and drawbacks of using Shadow IT in an enterprise setting.</p>

  <p>By the end of the week, I gained the ability to:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Clearly explain the differences between EIT and Shadow IT.</li>
    <li>Understand why some companies opt for Shadow IT.</li>
    <li>Evaluate the pros and cons of using Shadow IT within an organization.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Unit 5: Business Systems, Outsourcing and the Cloud</h2>
  <p>In <strong>Unit 5: Business Systems, Outsourcing and the Cloud</strong>, I explored the evolution of business systems and the shift from traditional models to modern cloud-based solutions. The unit delved into the rise and decline of outsourcing practices, including off-shoring and near-shoring, and how the emergence of cloud computing has become a significant alternative.</p>

  <p>I learned about different types of business systems and the historical context of their development through the four EIT Eras. The unit highlighted the pros and cons of outsourcing and its variants, discussing how businesses have leveraged these strategies to optimize operations and reduce costs.</p>
